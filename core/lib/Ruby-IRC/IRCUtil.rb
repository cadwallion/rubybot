# IRCUtil is a module that contains utility functions for use with the
# rest of Ruby-IRC. There is nothing required of the user to know or
# even use these functions, but they are useful for certain tasks
# regarding IRC connections.

    #
    # Matches hostmasks against hosts. Returns t/f on success/fail.
    # 
    # A hostmask consists of a simple wildcard that describes a 
    # host or class of hosts.
    # 
    # f.e., where the host is 'bar.example.com', a host mask 
    # of '*.example.com' would assert.
    #

    #
    # A utility function used by assert_hostmask() to turn hostmasks 
    # into regular expressions.
    #
    # Rarely, if ever, should be used by outside code. It's public
    # exposure is merely for those who are interested in it's
    # functionality.
